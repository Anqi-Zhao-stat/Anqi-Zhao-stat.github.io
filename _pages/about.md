I am a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at North Carolina State University. My current research interests include machine learning, conformal prediction, and causal inference.
You may find my CV [here](https://anqi-zhao-stat.github.io/assets/pdf/CV_website.pdf).

I am advised by Professor [Jungeum Kim](https://jungeumkim.com) on uncertainty quantification for AI. I am collaborating with Professor [Shu Yang](https://shuyang.wordpress.ncsu.edu) on biostatistics and causal inference, with a focus on developing conformal prediction methods for treatment regime learning. I am also collaborating with Professor [Wenbin Lu](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~wlu4//) on reinforcement learning approaches for survival analysis.

Prior to joining NC State, I earned an M.S. in Statistics from the University of Washington and a B.A. in Quantitative Economics, with a minor in Statistics, from the University of California, Irvine.
